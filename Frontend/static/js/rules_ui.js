      <section id="setup"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Game Set Up</h2><p>
      The following 7 events take place during set up:<br> 
        1. Players receive their secret agenda, the system will make sure at least two players have conflicting interests when assigning agendas.<br> 
        2. Players choose a color to represent themselves.<br> 
        3. Players choose a territory distribution that best fits their interests, The territory distributions are randomly generated by the system. Players take turns to choose their distribution, the order is randomly assigned by the system.<br> 
        4. Players choose one of their territories as the capital region.<br> 
        5. Players settle cities in two of their territories, turning them into urbanized regions.<br> 
        6. Players make initial deployment on their territories. The number of troops available for initial deployment equals the number of territories they control. Players whose turns are behind the queue will receive more troops for initial deployment. <br> 
        7. Players choose their War Art. The system will randomly take half of the available war arts as options to choose for each player.
      </p></section>

      <section id="flow"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Game Flow</h2><p>
        Players take turns to take actions. The order is determined by the action queue.<br> 
        1. Reinforcement<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinforcement stage allows players to deploy troops on their territories. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The number of deployable Troops is equal to the total points of all territories controlled by the player divided by 3 (round down).<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Normal territories are worth 1 point each, and special territories give extra points or bonus troops (see the Territory tab for more details).<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When an entire continent is controlled by a player, the player will receive Continental Bonus Troops. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on “Show continental border” to see how many Bonus Troops are given by each continent. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After deploying all troops, players enter the Preparation stage. <br> 
        2. Preparation <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Preparation stage, players can boost their strength by using Special Authority and by activating their War Art.  <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When all preparation is done, players enter the Conquest stage.  <br> 
        3. Conquest <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Conquest stage, players can attack bordering territories (maritime or land border). <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When players make a successful conquest during this stage, they will receive Special Authority (in units of stars) based on predetermined probabilities (see Special &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Authority section) at the end of the turn. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Special Authorities can be converted into reserves, cities, or infrastructure levels. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Battle stats of the player who is playing their turn are computed before the Conquest stage and they remain constant throughout the turn. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Urbanized regions, megacities, and transport hubs captured during the Conquest stage will not change <br>  
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the battle stats of the player before the end of their turn. <br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the Conquest stage, battle stat upgrades do not take effect until the end of the current turn. <br> 
        4.  Rearrangement<br> 
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Players rearrange troops on their territories.<br> 
      </p></section>

<section id="battle_mech"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Battle Mechanism</h2><p>
  The outcome of a battle is determined by a clash of dice. The number of dice used in a battle is determined by the number of troops.<br>
  Each troop is worth one die, which can roll from 1 to 6. <br>
  During a clash, the attacker rolls 3 dice, while the defender only rolls 2. <br>
  The two highest dice rolls on the attacker’s side are kept and compared to the rolls on the defender’s side. <br>
  The higher roll wins the clash. The die that loses the clash is discarded. <br>
  If the values are equal, the defender wins, and the attacker will lose one troop. <br>
  The 3rd attacker die is ignored but kept for the next clash. <br>
  The battle continues until one side runs out of troops. Troops discarded during the battle are permanently lost. <br>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Example:</h3>
  <p>If the attacker rolled: <strong>6 4 1</strong></p>
  <p>And the defender rolled: <strong>6 2</strong></p>
  <p>→ The 1 from the attacker is ignored. The system compares:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4">
    <li>6 vs 6 → draw → attacker loses 1 troop</li>
    <li>4 vs 2 → attacker wins → defender loses 1 troop</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Result: both sides lose 1 troop.</p>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Full Example Battle</h3>
  <p><strong>Attacker: 10 troops</strong><br><strong>Defender: 7 troops</strong></p>

<section id="stats"><h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Power Statistics</h2>
  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Industrial Level</h3>
    <p>A player's Industrial Level increases the maximum roll value of their dice, which are set to a default range of 1 to 6.</p>
    <p>The Industrial Level can be increased by controlling urbanized regions (either by conquering them or transforming a territory into an urbanized region). Urbanized regions are territories that have city/factory symbols on them (See Territories section).</p>
    <p>For the 1st level up, a player must control 3 urbanized regions. Afterward, every 2 additional urbanized regions controlled will increase their Industrial Level by 1.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Player A controls 5 cities, they will have +2 Industrial Level, 1 from controlling 3 cities and 1 from controlling another 2 cities. Their dice rolls will range from 1 to 8.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Infrastructure Level</h3>
    <p>A player’s Infrastructure Level can increase the number of dice used in a battle. By default, the number of dice allowed in a clash is set to 3 when attacking and 2 when defending.</p>
    <p>Players can upgrade their Infrastructure Level by spending their Special Authorities obtained during the Conquest phase. Each Infrastructure Level allows players 1 extra die when attacking and defending.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a player upgraded their Infrastructure Level by 2, they will be able to roll 5 dice when attacking and 4 dice when defending.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Player Power Index (PPI)</h3>
    <p>Player Power Index, or PPI, is a metric used to approximate how strong a player is relative to other players. It considers 4 aspects of a player:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>How many troops can be generated with the player’s currently controlled territories.</li>
      <li>How many troops the player currently owns.</li>
      <li>The industrial level of the player.</li>
      <li>The infrastructure level of the player.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The average of each of the 4 aspects is computed based on all active players. If a player has exceeded the average in many aspects, their PPI will be higher. Conversely, if a player’s stats are mostly lower than the average, their PPI will be a lower number.</p>
    <p>The player with the highest PPI is considered a <strong>Superpower</strong> by the system.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">War Art Related Combat Statistics</h2>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-2">Minimum Roll</h3>
    <p>The smallest number that can be rolled by a die, which is set at 1 by default. Minimum roll can be increased using War Arts such as <em>Elitocracy</em>, <em>Pandora’s Box</em>, and <em>Revanchism</em>.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-2">Damage Multiplier</h3>
    <p>Set to 1 by default. Can be increased using War Arts such as <em>Ares’ Blessing</em>, <em>Iron Wall</em>, <em>Elitocracy</em>, <em>Pandora’s Box</em>, and <em>Revanchism</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
    <p>Player A fights Player B using 10 troops against 10.</p>
    <p>Player A rolls: <strong>6 5 5</strong><br>Player B rolls: <strong>6 4 2</strong></p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
      <li>6 = 6 → draw → Player A loses 1 troop</li>
      <li>5 > 4 → Player B loses 1 troop</li>
      <li>5 > 2 → Player B loses 1 troop</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Normal: Player A has 9 troops left, Player B has 8.</p>
    <p>If Player A has x2 damage multiplier: Player B would have only 6 troops left instead of 8.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-2">Nullification Rate</h3>
    <p>Set to 0 by default. Can be increased using War Arts such as <em>Iron Wall</em>, <em>Pandora’s Box</em>, and <em>Revanchism</em>.</p>
    <p>Nullification rate grants players a chance to negate damage from enemies.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a player has a 40% nullification rate, then during battle, if the enemy has a higher roll, there is a 40% chance that the damage will be blocked, causing no loss.</p>

<section id="authority" class="space-y-6">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Special Authority</h2>

  <p>Special Authority makes it possible for players to upgrade their battle stats, activate special effects of certain War Arts, and mobilize reserves. It is quantified in units of stars (★).</p>

  <p>Special Authority can be obtained through battles. When a player makes a successful conquest during their turn, they will gain Special Authority based on the following probabilities:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
    <li>1★: 45%</li>
    <li>2★: 30%</li>
    <li>3★: 25%</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Every successful conquest during a player’s turn reduces the chance of getting 1★ by 5%, while increasing the chance of getting 2★ and 3★ by 2.5% each.</p>

  <p><strong>Example:</strong> If a player made 9 successful conquests, their chance would be:<br>
  2★: <strong>52.5%</strong>, 3★: <strong>47.5%</strong>, 1★: <strong>0%</strong></p>

  <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-4">Reserves</h3>
  <p>Reserves are troops that are on stand-by, hidden from opponents’ knowledge. They can be deployed whenever players want to make a major operation.</p>
  <p>Special Authority can be converted into reserves according to the following table:</p>

<section id="elimination"><h2 class="text-xl mt-1 font-bold">Elimination</h2>

  <p>There are two ways to eliminate (kill) a player:</p>

  <div>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold">Secret Agenda Failure</h3>
    <p>Some Secret Agendas include <strong>losing conditions</strong> that will instantly eliminate a player when triggered. Players with such Agenda are eliminated if they fail to complete their Secret Agenda.</p>
    <p>If a player is eliminated this way, it is <strong>not considered a “kill”</strong> by the system.</p>

        <h3>What Special Authority Is Used For</h3>
        <p>Special Authority allows players to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Upgrade military strength</li>
          <li>Create hidden reserves</li>

      <div class="content-box">
        <h3>How You Gain Special Authority</h3>
        <p>You mainly get <span class="star">★</span> by winning battles and taking land.</p>
        <p>At the end of your turn, if you captured at least one territory, you gain <span class="star">★</span>.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px;">The amount gained is determined by probability:</p>
        <div class="probability-grid">

        <h4>Momentum from Multiple Conquests</h4>
        <p>If you capture multiple territories in the same turn, your rewards improve.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Chance of 1★ decreases by 5%</li>
          <li>Chance of 2★ increases by 2.5%</li>
          <li>Chance of 3★ increases by 2.5%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After 9 successfuly conquests, you reached the max probability of getting 2★ or 3★.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 10px; font-weight: 600; color: #2ed573;">This rewards aggressive and well-planned turns.</p>

        <h3>Base Reinforcement Rule</h3>
        <p>At the start of your Reinforcement phase:</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 8px; font-weight: 600; color: #c9bfff;">You gain 1 troop for every 3 Territorial Points you control.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5px; font-size: 13px; color: #9a9a9a;">Fractions are ignored.</p>

          <p>If you fully control a continent, you gain bonus troops.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 5px;">• Each continent has a fixed bonus value</p>
          <p>• The bonus is added after the base reinforcement calculation</p>
          <p>• Losing control of any territory removes the bonus immediately</p>

          <p>• Add flat bonus troops</p>
          <p>• Change the base calculation rule</p>
